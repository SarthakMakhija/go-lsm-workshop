# go-lsm-workshop

Workshop on **Internals of key-value storage engines: LSM-trees and beyond** based on the [go-lsm](https://github.com/SarthakMakhija/go-lsm) repository.

### About the workshop

This workshop offers a deep dive into the practical aspects of building a an embedded key-value storage engine using the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. 
Participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts, starting with the intricacies of block devices, file I/O, and disk I/O patterns, along with a review of B+Trees for comparison.  
The workshop delves into the theoretical underpinnings of RUM conjecture and the LSM-tree itself, before transitioning into hands-on implementation. 

Attendees will learn to build core components such as Memtables, Write-Ahead Logs (WAL), and SSTables enhanced with Bloom filters.  
Finally, the workshop covers advanced topics like transaction management and compaction strategies, providing a complete roadmap for creating a robust and efficient storage engine. 

This hands-on experience will equip participants with the practical skills and theoretical knowledge necessary to tackle real-world storage challenges.
